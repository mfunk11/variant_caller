#Brief description of the datasets I will use for this project
1. SAMN07205120.fastq.gz, broken down into smaller segements
It will be a fastq file with the typical four rows of text, hopefully can be reduced down to a million reads or so. Current read length needs to be investigated.

2. BAM file for checking the functionality
3. Since primary functionality is variant caller, a BAM file will be used to check the functionality of only the variant caller portion, and not the rest of the file. I will probably use a small BAM file from my research. 
4. Files are on Great Lakes Server, but should be downloaded onto personal hard drive for use of the project
