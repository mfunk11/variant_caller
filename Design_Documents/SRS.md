I will use PyCharm for editing code files. 

I will use the terminal on my local machine for testing. I will probably need to use a Mac or Linux System, or a remote desktop for running the code. I may use Great Lakes for further usage and implementation.

A bam file and GFF will be about 30 GB total, so it will be easy to test on a personal hard drive. Files will be larger.

#System Requirements

- Java 1.8 (must be exact)
- Python 3
- STAR
- GATK 4.2

#Input
Fastq File(s), VCF or BED File, Reference Genome, GFF file (optional)
#Output
- After STAR: BAM Files
- After GATK: new VCF file
- Ultimately, a genome browser with highlighted tracks.
