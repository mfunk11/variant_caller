Technology will include personal hard drive for storage, and personal laptop. May use great lakes cluster for running if I can get permission. Otherwise, the 5 TB hard disk should do the trick.



I will use PyCharm for editing code files.

I will use the terminal on my local machine for testing. I will probably need to use a Mac or Linux System, or a remote desktop for running the code.

A bam file and GFF will be about 30 GB total, so it will be easy to test on a personal hard drive. Files will be larger.
