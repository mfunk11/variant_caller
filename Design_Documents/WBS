Project Input: Single or Paired end fastq files; reference genome
Project Output: Genome Browser Pop-up Window with highlighted variants

Task 1: Develop the Alignment Pipeline
 1.1 - write code to generate index in STAR
 1.2 - write code to generate alignment in STAR
 1.3 - Test
Task 2: Create the GATK Pipeline
 2.1 - look at dogmap code for reference for using GATK functions
 2.2 - model GATK code based on Dogmap Code
 2.3 - Test on TAIR 10
Task 3: Develop the API
  3.1 - Use OpenAPI 3.0 as a platform
  3.2 - Connect from local machine to USGS website
Task 4: Modify Genome Browser
  4.1- Highlight variant regions
   4.1.1- Consider different options for highlighting; probably try to make highlights an additional track on Genome Browser
Task 5: Display Output Window
  5.1 - Find an appropriate tool for this purpose
Task 6: Consider Options
  6.1 - Potentially add a different aligner like bwa or hisat2
  6.2 - enable different GATK settings
